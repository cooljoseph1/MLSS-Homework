This doesn't make sense...  If $f \in \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{X})$ then $2f$ and $-f$ are also in $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal X)$.  So, the supremum doesn't exist.  Did you intend to define $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal X)$ as a bounded space of continuous functions from $\mathcal X$ to $\mathbb R$, not a space of bounded functions?

The empircal version of this statement would be
$$\sup_{f \in \mathcal F}$$
