### 1
$pd$, $p\sqrt{d}$, and $p$, respectively.

### 2
$\alpha = \beta = 1$:  uniform
$\alpha = \beta = 5$:  peak at center
$\alpha = \beta = 0.5$:  peak at corners

### 3
a) true  (you want to maximize $l(x)_{t}$)
b) false
c) true
d) true

### 4
(b) is the only answer that is always true

### 5
a) false
b) false
c) true
d) true

### 6
a) false
b) true
c) true (the $l_\infty$ norm is always less than or equal to the $l_2$ norm, so you have a bigger budget)
d) false (why would this be true??)

### 7
a) true
b) true
c) true
d) true
e) true

### 8
a) false--they have the same image classes as ImageNet, and their purpose is to test adversarial robustness, not generalization.
b) false--they weren't generated through a GAN (a GAN's purpose is not to create adversarial examples, but true computer-generated examples)
c) false
d) false (it's used for image classification datasets)
e) true
