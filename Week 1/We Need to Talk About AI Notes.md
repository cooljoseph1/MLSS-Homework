## Claims made -- Are they actually true?
### AGI is 25-50 years out
I think it will be less time.

### AGI will take a few hundred years.
I think it will take less time.

### The internet drove forward AI development because of easier access to data.
This is probably true.

### A self-driving car will have to make ethical decisions.
I don't believe this.
- There will rarely ever be an *ethical* dillema on the road.
- The programmer will code in these kinds of decisions

### Making machines more intelligent than us will eventually be a reality.
I believe it.

### A machine with general intelligence will have consciousness.
I mean, that's kind of ambiguous without a clear definition of consciousness.  (Or is it supposed to *be* a definition?)

### Thinking and feeling will come together.
What do they mean by feeling?  Emotions?  I think this is unlikely.  Feelings are our way of approximating our utility function, but there are much more efficient ways to do so.




## Assertion significantly less true in 2020 than in 2022
### Our present AI systems are very *very* narrow at what they do.
This is false.  Look at Gato, for example.
