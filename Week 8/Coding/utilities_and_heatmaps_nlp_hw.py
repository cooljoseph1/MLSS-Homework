# Saliency Map for NLP (heatmap) v1.1

We begin with learning about how to generate heatmaps to visualize a per token model explanation.  We will be using the package `thermostat` which provides a score per token.  Later in the homework you will investigate creating that score yourself by computing the gradients.

We're going to load the DeBerta model to see how to generate heatmaps from a model instead of using pregenerated model outputs.  

The basic plan we will be following is detailed below.

1.  We will be loading the model and corresponding tokenizer.  Note that the model and tokenizers go hand in hand.
1.  We will compute the gradients of the model and write up a description of what it means.
1.  We will recreate the above renderer to be able to display the utility of each word.
1. We will be examining some inconsistencies or failures of current language models.
1. We will ask you to see if you can discover any other inconsistencies yourself.

*  Please write equation for computing the gradient of the loss (L2 loss) with respect to the weights of the last layer.  This is a general equation not specific to any architecture or model.
* Expanding on the above how does the equation change if I tell you that the weights are a convolution kernel? the weights are a linear operator? 
*  Please describe what the gradients of the loss with respect to the inputs represents.
*  What does the does the gradient of the loss with respect to the input represent when you take the negative of the loss?

*   Let $W$ be the weight matrix, $b$ be the bias vector, $\sigma$ be the activation function, $x$ be the inputs to the last layer, and $y$ be the correct value for the outputs.  The output to the last layer is $\sigma(Wx + b)$, so the loss we want to minimize is
$$\sum_{i = 1}^N \frac12(\sigma(Wx + b) - y)^2.$$
This can be done via gradient descent.  The gradient is
$$\sum_{i = 1}^N\frac{\partial}{\partial W} \frac12(\sigma(Wx + b) - y)^2 = \sum_{i=1}^N (\sigma(Wx + b) - y) \frac{\partial}{\partial W} \sigma(Wx + b).$$
*   If the weights are a convolutional kernel, the above equation does not change.  If the last layer is a linear function $x \mapsto Tx$, then the above equation can be simplified greatly to
$$\begin{bmatrix} x\\\hline x\\\hline \vdots \\\hline x \end{bmatrix}(Tx - y).$$

*   It represents the direction in which if you perturb the inputs you will cause the greatest increase in the loss (i.e. the input that causes the model to approximate the output the worst).
