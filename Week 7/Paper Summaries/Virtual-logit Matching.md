# ViM: Out-Of-Distribution with Virtual-logit Matching
Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is important for a variety of reasons (e.g. detecting when the model is being deployed in situations it shouldn't be).  This paper describes a method to do OOD detection by creating a virtual logit that represents how out of distribution the input is.
